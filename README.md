# LiverPatientAnalysis
Predict whether patient has liver disease or not using real world data set. The prediction can be done by patient using Mobile application and also doctor can view the patients results.

## Project Explanation
This application for patients and doctors to check they have liver disease or not based on their test report.
The application have two types of logins, 
    - doctors login, To get details & report analysis of their patients
    - patients login, To get details and of own analysis report.
The patients have to enter their test report data in to this application. The Machine learning model will predict they have liver disease or not
based on their report.
Doctors can see the patients test report and its analysis by machine learning model.

## Components
This project has these major components,

 - Android application
 - PHP
 - MySQL
 - Machine learning model.

###### Android application
  We use the android application as our front end, This application is for bank employees.
###### PHP & MySQL
  PHP script is used to make rest api's and serve the data from MySQL database.
  MySQL database stored customer account details.
###### Machine learning Backend
  Machine learning model is used to classify the user will subscribe the term deposit or not.
  The analytical data need for train model are stored in excel sheet. By use of pandas library used to train the model

## Languages used
Android application developed using java,xml languages.
Back end is developed using Php and mysql database
Machine learning model is created using python and pandas library.

## Hosting:-
PHP & Database is hosted in localhost
Machin learning model is hosted in IBM cloud (watson studio).
